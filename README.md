# 🍽️ Meal Recommendation CLI & GUI App

## 📚 Description

This is a Python application that helps users select and view recipes based on the moment of the day (breakfast, lunch, snack, or dinner). The project features both a **GUI interface using Tkinter** and a **CLI-based interaction**, combining data organization with user-friendly design.

Recipes are categorized, include ingredients and preparation steps, and can be scaled for different portions in the case of lunch or dinner meals.
